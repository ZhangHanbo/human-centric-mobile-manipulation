Can a robot effectively perform mobile manipulation tasks in real-world environments with humans? As mobile manipulators transition from controlled lab settings into human-centered environments such as homes, hospitals, and workplaces, they must not only navigate and manipulate objects, but also communicate and collaborate with humans in a safe, intuitive, and efficient manner. Despite recent advances in autonomous mobile manipulation, robots continue to struggle with two fundamental challenges. First, establishing **intuitive and reliable human–robot interaction** that allows humans to convey intent, provide feedback, and intervene when necessary. Second, planning and executing **human-aware motion and manipulation behaviors** that explicitly account for human presence, safety, comfort, and collaborative dynamics. Addressing these challenges is essential for enabling robots to operate as effective partners rather than isolated autonomous agents in real-world, human-centric environments. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to develop a shared understanding of these challenges, explore emerging solutions, and identify promising research directions in human-centric mobile manipulation.

In particular, this workshop aims to address the following questions:
* How should tasks, goals, constraints, and preferences be specified for mobile manipulation in human environments?
* How can robots plan and act in ways that are explicitly aware of human presence, safety, and comfort?

### <center>Workshop Scope & Topics</center>

The workshop will cover, but is not limited to, the following topics:

* Human-to-robot interfaces for mobile manipulation
* Task specification and interaction modalities (language, demonstrations, teleoperation, etc.)
* Human-aware motion planning and manipulation
* Foundation models for human-centered mobile manipulation
* Learning from and adapting to human preferences
* Shared autonomy and responsibility allocation
* Uncertainty- and safety-aware planning
* Failure prediction, detection, recovery, and online human intervention
* Benchmarks and evaluation for human-centric manipulation systems

### <center> Call for Demos </center>

We invite short videos and live demos showcasing **human-centric mobile manipulation systems**, including human–robot interaction, human-aware motion and manipulation planning, shared autonomy, and failure recovery in real-world settings. Demos can be either in **simulation** or **real-world**. All demos will be set up and shown on **[RoboMesh](https://tom-bridge.nusssi.com/robomesh)** interactively.

Please refer to the [Call for Demos]({{ '/callfordemos/' | relative_url }}) for more details.

🏆 **Best Demo Award**: *TBD*

<br>

### <center>Call for Papers</center>

We invite paper submissions related to **human-centric mobile manipulation**, including human-robot interface design, human-aware planning, uncertainty and safety, shared autonomy, learning from human feedback, and benchmark design.

Please refer to the [Call for Papers]({{ '/callforpapers/' | relative_url }}) for submission guidelines.

🏆 **Best Paper Award**: *TBD*
