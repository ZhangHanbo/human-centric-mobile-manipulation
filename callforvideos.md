We invite **live, interactive demos** showcasing human-centric mobile manipulation systems. All demos will be deployed and demonstrated through **[RoboMesh](https://tom-bridge.nusssi.com/robomesh/)**, a web-based platform that enables **online interaction with robots**.

Submitted demos should support real-time human–robot interaction via one or more of the following modalities:
- Text or language-based commands  
- Voice interaction  
- Web-based gestures such as clicking, dragging, and pointing  

Demos are expected to illustrate human–robot interaction, shared autonomy, human-aware planning, or human intervention and failure recovery in realistic mobile manipulation scenarios. **All live demos will be invited to present for oral talks.**

In addition to live demos, we also welcome **video demos** for systems that are not yet ready for live deployment. Video demos should clearly illustrate the interaction design, system behavior, and key challenges addressed, and may be selected during for discussion.
