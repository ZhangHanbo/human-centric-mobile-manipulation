We invite workshop paper submissions on ideas and experimental evaluations related to open-world navigation (OWN). Accepted papers will be released on the workshop website (as non-archival publications) after the conclusion of the workshop.

Papers may be based on new and unpublished work, or may be an abstract based on prior publications. Authors whose work belongs to the former category may highlight this during submission. The organizers will strive to provide more comprehensive reviews for such papers.

### Topics of Interest
We invite contributions in areas including, but not limited to the following navigation-related topics:

* **Generalizing Navigation to the Open World**
    * Generalizable perception/semantic understanding
    * Generalizable control/motion generation
    * Generalizable decision-making/reasoning/planning
    * Generalizable, multimodal task specification
    * World models for navigation
    * End-to-end approaches for navigation
* **Current Limitations of Navigation in the Open World**
    * Failure modes of navigation systems
    * Failure modes of learned/foundation models
* **Handling Failures**
    * Uncertainty estimation for learned/foundation models
    * Out-of-distribution detection for learned/foundation models
    * Failure detection in navigation
    * Robustness to failures and failure handling approaches
* **Datasets/Benchmarks**
    * Large-scale datasets for OWN
    * Benchmarks for OWN

### Submission Instructions and Important Dates:
Submissions should be 2-4 pages (not including references), following the IROS format. The submission and review process will proceed through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=IEEE.org/IROS/2025/Workshop/OWN).
